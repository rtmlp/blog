            "content": "The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel . My rating: 5 of 5 stars . Review . . Enjoyed reading this book. In the first few chapters, I got a bit impatient with the extended narrative on simple things but the author introduced several interesting ways to think about money, investing, risk, happiness, and growth. The idea of saving money just for the sake of it and not specifically for anything is anti-thesis of how saving money is being campaigned in the mainstream media. The last section on how the united states turned from a savings economy (before world war II) to a consumer economy and how that is impacting the debt to income ratio metric is interesting. . View all my reviews . Highlights - 137 . . The fact that Ronald Read can coexist with Richard Fuscone has two explanations. One, financial outcomes are driven by luck, independent of intelligence and effort. That’s true to some extent, and this book will discuss it in further detail. Or, two (and I think more common), that financial success is not a hard science. It’s a soft skill, where how you behave is more important than what you know. | . highlight @ loc. 74-77 . Most of the reason why, I believe, is that we think about and are taught about money in ways that are too much like physics (with rules and laws) and not enough like psychology (with emotions and nuance). | . highlight @ loc. 95-97 . Your personal experiences with money make up maybe 0.00000001% of what’s happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how you think the world works. | . highlight @ loc. 134-135 . “Our findings suggest that individual investors’ willingness to bear risk depends on personal history.” | . highlight @ loc. 162-163 . Few people make financial decisions purely with a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a company meeting. Places where personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together into a narrative that works for you. | . highlight @ loc. 219-221 . It should surprise no one that many of us are bad at saving and investing for retirement. We’re not crazy. We’re all just newbies. | . highlight @ loc. 241-242 . For a topic that is so influenced by emotion versus fact, this is a problem. And it helps explain why we don’t always do what we’re supposed to with money. | . highlight @ loc. 250-252 . “Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems.” | . highlight @ loc. 257-257 . Luck and risk are both the reality that every outcome in life is guided by forces other than individual effort. | . highlight @ loc. 297-298 . Luck and risk are both the reality that every outcome in life is guided by forces other than individual effort. They are so similar that you can’t believe in one without equally respecting the other. They both happen because the world is too complex to allow 100% of your actions to dictate 100% of your outcomes. They are driven by the same thing: You are one person in a game with seven billion other people and infinite moving parts. The accidental impact of actions outside of your control can be more consequential than the ones you consciously take. | . highlight @ loc. 297-301 . They are so similar that you can’t believe in one without equally respecting the other. | . highlight @ loc. 298-299 . When judging others, attributing success to luck makes you look jealous and mean, even if we know it exists. And when judging yourself, attributing success to luck can be too demoralizing to accept. | . highlight @ loc. 311-312 . It’s too hard. We prefer simple stories, which are easy but often devilishly misleading. | . highlight @ loc. 325-325 . Be careful who you praise and admire. Be careful who you look down upon and wish to avoid becoming. | . highlight @ loc. 372-373 . Therefore, focus less on specific individuals and | . highlight @ loc. 377-378 . Therefore, focus less on specific individuals and case studies and more on broad patterns. | . highlight @ loc. 377-378 . My favorite historian, Frederick Lewis Allen, spent his career depicting the life of the average, median American—how they lived, how they changed, what they did for work, what they ate for dinner, etc. | . highlight @ loc. 386-387 . When things are going extremely well, realize it’s not as good as you think. You are not invincible, and if you acknowledge that luck brought you success then you have to believe in luck’s cousin, risk, which can turn your story around just as quickly. | . highlight @ loc. 390-391 . Crime committed by those living on the edge of survival is one thing. A Nigerian scam artist once told The New York Times that he felt guilty for hurting others, but “poverty will not make you feel the pain.”¹³ | . highlight @ loc. 442-443 . To make money they didn’t have and didn’t need, they risked what they did have and did need. And that’s foolish. It is just plain foolish. | . highlight @ loc. 449-450 . If you risk something that is important to you for something that is unimportant to you, it just does not make any sense. | . highlight @ loc. 450-451 . Modern capitalism is a pro at two things: generating wealth and generating envy. | . highlight @ loc. 460-460 . On the other end there’s Rajat Guptas and Bernie Madoffs in the world, who resort to stealing because every dollar is worth reaching for regardless of consequence. | . highlight @ loc. 481-482 . The ability to stick around for a long time, without wiping out or being forced to give up, is what makes the biggest difference. This should be the cornerstone of your strategy, whether it’s in investing or your career or a business you own. | . highlight @ loc. 631-633 . He survived. Survival gave him longevity. And longevity—investing consistently from age 10 to at least age 89—is what made compounding work wonders. That single point is what matters most when describing his success. | . highlight @ loc. 645-646 . No one wants to hold cash during a bull market. They want to own assets that go up a lot. You look and feel conservative holding cash during a bull market, because you become acutely aware of how much return you’re giving up by not owning the good stuff. Say cash earns 1% and stocks return 10% a year. That 9% gap will gnaw at you every day. But if that cash prevents you from having to sell your stocks during a bear market, the actual return you earned on that cash is not 1% a year—it could be many multiples of that, because preventing one desperate, ill-timed stock sale can do more for your lifetime returns than picking dozens of big-time winners. | . highlight @ loc. 661-666 . Many bets fail not because they were wrong, but because they were mostly right in a situation that required things to be exactly right. | . highlight @ loc. 678-679 . Room for error—often called margin of safety—is one of the most underappreciated forces in finance. It comes in many forms: A frugal budget, flexible thinking, and a loose timeline—anything that lets you live happily with a range of outcomes. | . highlight @ loc. 680-681 . Conservative is avoiding a certain level of risk. Margin of safety is raising the odds of success at a given level of risk by increasing your chances of survival. | . highlight @ loc. 682-683 . A mindset that can be paranoid and optimistic at the same time is hard to maintain, because seeing things as black or white takes less effort than accepting nuance. | . highlight @ loc. 708-709 . The highest form of wealth is the ability to wake up every morning and say, “I can do whatever I want today.” | . highlight @ loc. 847-848 . Happiness is a complicated subject because everyone’s different. But if there’s a common denominator in happiness— a universal fuel of joy—it’s that people want to control their lives. | . highlight @ loc. 849-850 . Having a strong sense of controlling one’s life is a more dependable predictor of positive feelings of wellbeing than any of the objective conditions of life we have considered. | . highlight @ loc. 858-859 . Money’s greatest intrinsic value—and this can’t be overstated —is its ability to give you control over your time. | . highlight @ loc. 861-862 . But doing something you love on a schedule you can’t control can feel the same as doing something you hate. There is a name for this feeling. Psychologists call it reactance. | . highlight @ loc. 879-880 . When we try to get them to do something, they feel disempowered. Rather than feeling like they made the choice, they feel like we made it for them. So they say no or do something else, even when they might have originally been happy to go along.²⁵ | . highlight @ loc. 881-883 .

But the way to be rich is to spend money you have, and to not spend money you don’t have. It’s really that simple.”³¹ | . highlight @ loc. 985-986 . It is excellent advice, but it may not go far enough. The only way to be wealthy is to not spend the money that you do have. It’s not just the only way to accumulate wealth; it’s the very definition of wealth. | . highlight @ loc. 986-988 . Not knowing the difference is a source of countless poor money decisions. | . highlight @ loc. 989-989 . But wealth is hidden. It’s income not spent. | . highlight @ loc. 992-992 . The first idea—simple, but easy to overlook—is that building wealth has little to do with your income or investment returns, and lots to do with your savings | . highlight @ loc. 1021-1022 . Learning to be happy with less money creates a gap between what you have and what you want—similar to the gap you get from growing your paycheck, but easier and more in your control. | . highlight @ loc. 1047-1049 .

Think of it like this, and one of the most powerful ways to increase your savings isn’t to raise your income. It’s to raise your humility. | . highlight @ loc. 1060-1061 . Only saving for a specific goal makes sense in a predictable world. But ours isn’t. | . highlight @ loc. 1071-1072 . Savings without a spending goal gives you options and flexibility, the ability to wait and the opportunity to pounce. | . highlight @ loc. 1076-1077 . Every bit of savings is like taking a point in the future that would have been owned by someone else and giving it back to yourself. That flexibility and control over your time is an unseen return on wealth. What is the return on cash in the bank that gives you the option of changing careers, or | . highlight @ loc. 1078-1080 . Every bit of savings is like taking a point in the future that would have been owned by someone else and giving it back to yourself. | . highlight @ loc. 1078-1079 . When you don’t have control over your time, you’re forced to accept whatever bad luck is thrown your way. But if you have flexibility you have the time to wait for no-brainer opportunities to fall in your lap. This is a hidden return on your savings. | . highlight @ loc. 1083-1085 .

But it is often used by investors and economists as an unassailable guide to the future. | . highlight @ loc. 1208-1209 . History is littered with good ideas taken too far, which are indistinguishable from bad ideas. The wisdom in having room for error is acknowledging that uncertainty, randomness, and chance—“unknowns”—are an ever-present part of life. The only way to deal with them is by increasing the gap between what you think will happen and what can happen while still leaving you capable of fighting another day. | . highlight @ loc. 1370-1373 .

But people underestimate the need for room for error in almost everything they do that involves money. | . highlight @ loc. 1383-1384 . Leverage is the devil here. Leverage—taking on debt to make your money go further—pushes routine risks into something capable of producing ruin. | . highlight @ loc. 1430-1431 . The danger is that rational optimism most of the time masks the odds of ruin some of the time. The result is we systematically underestimate risk. | . highlight @ loc. 1431-1432 .

Aiming, at every point in your working life, to have moderate annual savings, moderate free time, no more than a moderate commute, and at least moderate time with your family, increases the odds of being able to stick with a plan and avoid regret than if any one of those things fall to the extreme sides of the spectrum. | . highlight @ loc. 1533-1535 . sunk costs.’”⁴⁹ Sunk costs—anchoring decisions to past efforts that can’t be refunded—are a devil in a world where people change over time. | . highlight @ loc. 1546-1547 .

Most things are harder in practice than they are in theory. Sometimes this is because we’re overconfident.

Being swayed by people playing a different game can also throw off how you think you’re supposed to spend your money. | . highlight @ loc. 1723-1724 . So much consumer spending, particularly in developed countries, is socially driven: subtly influenced by people you admire, and done because you subtly want people to admire you. | . highlight @ loc. 1724-1725 .

Pessimism just sounds smarter and more plausible than optimism. | . highlight @ loc. 1774-1775 . This is true beyond finance. Matt Ridley wrote in his book The Rational Optimist: | . highlight @ loc. 1784-1785 . “Every group of people I ask thinks the world is more frightening, more violent, and more hopeless—in short, more dramatic—than it really is,” Hans Rosling wrote in his book Factfulness. | . highlight @ loc. 1788-1790 .

And you’re more likely to gain those things through kindness and humility than horsepower and chrome. | . highlight @ loc. 2104-2105 . Save. Just save. You don’t need a specific reason to save.

But saving for things that are impossible to predict or define is one of the best reasons to save. | . highlight @ loc. 2106-2108 . Everyone’s life is a continuous chain of surprises.

When I started reading this book, I was unsure whether I could invest time in reading all the books in series (10 in total) as the first book alone has 1137 pages. But it was totally worth the read. . The book established the characters, society, themes and concepts in the Cosmere world really well. While reading the last quarter of the book, I couldn’t put it down without reading it for at least three hours straight in a sitting. By the time I finished reading this book, I had got so astonished by the twists and turns and took few hours just to absorb what I had just read . I am excited to start the second book in this series, Words of radiance :) . Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination.

            "content": "Imperfect by Sanjay Manjrekar My rating: 4 of 5 stars . Review . I have not watched any match that Sanjay played for India, but I watched many matches in which he was a commentator. I liked his commentary, and as he came across as someone who is not afraid to call a spade as a spade. Coming to this book, I liked the first few chapters, where Sanjay explained how his childhood shaped his career choice as a cricketer and his batting style (defensive). Sanjay played cricket for fame and is forthcoming about it. It is interesting to read about Mumbai cricket scene, Ranji tournaments, and North vs West zone rivalry. Sadly, Sanjay played cricket when India is not competitive in away matches, not aggressive in their approach towards the game, and not supportive to fellow cricketers. Since I did not watch any of his matches, I could not connect to much of Sanjay’s cricketing life. However, in the last chapter, Sanjay goes into the details about his life as a commentator. Sanjay chose to be a commentator to be visible in the public eye and not fade out like other cricketers in his generation. As a commentator, Sanjay can get extremely critical because of his analytical mindset. However, many cricketers/viewers took it personally instead of seeing it as a person doing his job. I am glad Sanjay is not backing down from being critical as some of the commentators do not trust the intelligence of the viewers. It is a welcoming book if you are interested in the game.

I didn’t know much about Nike’s history until I read this book by Phil Knight.I loved Phil’s travel stories from around the world. Traveling around the world at such an early age helped Phil understand the intricacies of different cultures, enabling him to navigate supply chain constraints later. Phil didn’t start Blue Ribbon to create the best shoe company. The whole idea of starting a company is an afterthought after receiving a contract to sell shoes in the US. Gradually, the business turned into an obsession, which led to create and sell a new line of shoes. It’s amusing to read Phil’s struggle to keep Blue Ribbon afloat, flaunt bank rules, steal an official’s notes. Amusing as it’s so well written without adding the heaviness of creating a billion-dollar company or being preachy with some entrepreneurship BS. . View all my reviews .",

In the 60’s, around national parks, human’s attitude towards bears is more casual as there weren’t lot of attacks. So there weren’t strict rules around approaching bears, or feeding them. But the two events in August, 1967 at Glacier National Park shifted our behavior towards bears - to be more watchful for their presence, to not feed them, to not run away from them. The events which were transcribed in detail in this book, helped to change the infrastructure around the campgrounds, food storage etc. over the years from mid 60’s.While Grizzlies are fascinating creatures they command fear and attention, their attitude towards humans evolved over the years.

            "content": "The Truth: An Uncomfortable Book About Relationships by Neil Strauss . My rating: 4 of 5 stars . Review . This book discusses various aspects of Niel’s life from childhood to his present life and informs us how the past, especially childhood, can still influence the present and the future.Laurene’s idea of a healthy relationship stuck in my head as I think a lot about what it means to be independent as an individual and in a relationship. In relationships where a person depends on another person for several needs (for example, financial needs), how do the dynamics of the healthy relationship change? . A healthy relationship is when two individuated adults decide to have a relationship, and that becomes a third entity. They nurture the relationship, and the relationship nurtures them. But they’re not overly dependent or independent, but they are interdependent, which means that they take care of most of their needs and wants on their own. When they can’t do something on their own, they are not afraid to ask their partner for help. When our love for someone exceeds our need for them to, we have a shot at a genuine relationship together . Oh my!! Neil goes completely crazy when he decides to leave the therapy altogether to explore poly lifestyle. But it’s tough to be confident about the recovery process when there are red flags around the recovery steps and the process. Neil couldn’t trust the system that failed to make any logical sense to him as his teachers had hidden motives and so failed to answer all his logical questionsThe third part of the book expands a lot on his new lifestyle often unnecessarily. The ending seems rushed with over simplification of his issues and failure to add any details about the life of Neil and Ingrid around the time they decide to get married . Overall, the book feels like a honest narrative of a narcissistic person who tried to find the meaning of love within the constraints posed by his own lifestyle and upbringing. I came to know that in 2018, the couple filed for divorce and are happily(sic) separated. So the reader should exercise some caution while making conclusions from the book about love and relationships. View all my reviews .",

I had to spend some time to transition from non-linear story to linear story writing. . When I think about Bill’s parents, all I can think of are the ways they tried to help Bill to succeed in his life. They tried their best to support Bill with money, college education, marriage, etc. They never imposed any of their necessities on Bill. Bill is also empathetic of his parent’s life and difficulties. As Bill aged, he and his parents became strangers and he felt that his love increased by its loss . “If you think you ought to stay here and study your books, then that’s what you ought to do” - Bill’s father on spending additional years at the University for Master of Arts . “Think you could manage the place all by yourself?” - Bill to his parents while mentioning that he won’t be coming back . Bill’s marriage is a disaster. And that is one of the biggest mistakes of his life. It’s so tough to see him struggle through the marriage without ever being loved until Katherine entered into his life. . “He stared up into the dark and wondered at the strangeness that had come over his life, and for the first time questioned the wisdom of what he was about to do” - Bill contemplating on his marriage . While Bill is numb to certain feelings (world wars, patriotism, office politics), he is deeply interested in literature and teaching and thus spends a lot of time in the university. The university becomes his go-to place to avoid struggles at home and social life . During his early 40s, he had a midlife crisis where he questions his past and future. But when Katherine enters his life at 43, he had a turnaround. He leads two separate lives - one with Katherine and one with Edith. Their relationship turns from passion, to lust, and finally to love. But due to the fight with Holly, he had to suffer through his academics and love life . “that the person one loves at first is not the person one loves at last, and that love is not an end but a process through which one person attempts to know another” - when Katherine left Bill . “Oh, how proper we seem to ourselves when we have no reason to be improper” Katherine and Bill on being improper . Bill is devoid of any feeling in his life after Katherine leaves him. He doesn’t care for Edith’s tantrums or for his daughter’s college life. . In the end, this book is neither for one looking for motivation nor for one who is looking for a happy ending. It’s a depressing book that is brutally honest about a person who manages to feel all the emotions that life had to offer him and not willing to bend of any one emotion. He took pride and enjoyment in his education, accepted tumultuous life with Edith, suffered while teaching 3-4 courses every semester for almost 40 years, didn’t hold back when he aspired for love outside his marriage, didn’t fight against the department head until the end, etc. . “He had conceived wisdom, and at the end of the long years he had found ignorance” - Bill at the end of his life View all my reviews .

            "content": "Death’s End by Liu Cixin My rating: 5 of 5 stars I like the way how it all ended. Liu introduced so many ideas and adds lot of context to them. For example, all the stories related to the Storyless Kingdom , Bunker Project, Sophons, and Museums on Pluto made the book really interesting. The book is centered around Cheng Xin who had to bear the consequences of her actions when Trisolaris tried to attack and when she stops Thomas Wade from continuing his particle accelerator research. She never ceased to be human even when she entered the space and got freed from EarthIt’s tough to understand the struggle faced by BlueSpace and Origin crew members but the concepts about “Desubstantiation effect”, conscience and duty in the Outer space can help reader imagine how humans can possibly change once they leave Earth . “Desubstantiation effect” was a concept from astronautic psychology. Humans on Earth were surrounded by objects, and the image of the world in their subconscious was thus material and substantial. But in deep space, away from the Solar System, the stars were only distant points of light and the galaxy was nothing more than a luminous mist. To the senses and the mind, the world lost its materiality, and empty space dominated . There are also some philosophical questions that Liu raised through out this book1. What happens to life when it becomes calm and dull, with no more changes, no more stimulation and surprises2. How survival can be effected by weakness, ignorance and arrogance3.

This book discusses various issues humans face when the battle gets inevitable—defeatism, triumphalism, nostalgic feelings, future civilization, etc. The issues are conveyed by intertwining them in the book narration . Tri-Solaris attempts to assassinate Luo Ji using a custom virus mapped to his DNA in the standard era, and the killer 5.2 software virus in the crisis-era shows the author’s creativity to adapt the writing style. . The birth of a new civilization is the formation of a new morality . Zhang Behai’s portrayal as a triumphalist despite being a defeatist shows his meticulous planning and his responsibility towards its duties. The new Space Earth civilization has to adapt to a new home and change their morality to survive in the spaceship. . Not being able to save the world isn’t your fault, but giving the world hope only to shatter it again is an unforgivable sin . The way Luo Ji gets ridiculed after being called the Messiah for saving the Earth shows us how humans react to hope and how powerful and malleable it is . The book picks up the pace in the last 1/3 of the book, which I could finish in one sitting. I had to struggle through some portions in the first two sections of the book. The Battle of Darkness with the droplet’s superior surface composition changed the whole expectation from the war . I am not sure what to expect for the final book Death’s End as this book ties a lot of loose ends and completes without much curiosity about the next book.
