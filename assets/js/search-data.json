            "content": "The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson . My rating: 5 of 5 stars . Review . . Masterpiece !!! The best fiction book that I have read so far. When I started reading this book, I was unsure whether I could invest time in reading all the books in series (10 in total) as the first book alone has 1137 pages. But it was totally worth the read. . The book established the characters, society, themes and concepts in the Cosmere world really well. While reading the last quarter of the book, I couldn’t put it down without reading it for at least three hours straight in a sitting. By the time I finished reading this book, I had got so astonished by the twists and turns and took few hours just to absorb what I had just read . I am excited to start the second book in this series, Words of radiance :) . Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination.

            "title": "Imperfect",
            "content": "Imperfect by Sanjay Manjrekar My rating: 4 of 5 stars . Review . I have not watched any match that Sanjay played for India, but I watched many matches in which he was a commentator. I liked his commentary, and as he came across as someone who is not afraid to call a spade as a spade. Coming to this book, I liked the first few chapters, where Sanjay explained how his childhood shaped his career choice as a cricketer and his batting style (defensive). Sanjay played cricket for fame and is forthcoming about it. It is interesting to read about Mumbai cricket scene, Ranji tournaments, and North vs West zone rivalry. Sadly, Sanjay played cricket when India is not competitive in away matches, not aggressive in their approach towards the game, and not supportive to fellow cricketers. Since I did not watch any of his matches, I could not connect to much of Sanjay’s cricketing life. However, in the last chapter, Sanjay goes into the details about his life as a commentator. Sanjay chose to be a commentator to be visible in the public eye and not fade out like other cricketers in his generation. As a commentator, Sanjay can get extremely critical because of his analytical mindset. However, many cricketers/viewers took it personally instead of seeing it as a person doing his job. I am glad Sanjay is not backing down from being critical as some of the commentators do not trust the intelligence of the viewers. It is a welcoming book if you are interested in the game.

I didn’t know much about Nike’s history until I read this book by Phil Knight.I loved Phil’s travel stories from around the world. Traveling around the world at such an early age helped Phil understand the intricacies of different cultures, enabling him to navigate supply chain constraints later. Phil didn’t start Blue Ribbon to create the best shoe company. The whole idea of starting a company is an afterthought after receiving a contract to sell shoes in the US. Gradually, the business turned into an obsession, which led to create and sell a new line of shoes. It’s amusing to read Phil’s struggle to keep Blue Ribbon afloat, flaunt bank rules, steal an official’s notes. Amusing as it’s so well written without adding the heaviness of creating a billion-dollar company or being preachy with some entrepreneurship BS. . View all my reviews .",

In the 60’s, around national parks, human’s attitude towards bears is more casual as there weren’t lot of attacks. So there weren’t strict rules around approaching bears, or feeding them. But the two events in August, 1967 at Glacier National Park shifted our behavior towards bears - to be more watchful for their presence, to not feed them, to not run away from them. The events which were transcribed in detail in this book, helped to change the infrastructure around the campgrounds, food storage etc. over the years from mid 60’s.While Grizzlies are fascinating creatures they command fear and attention, their attitude towards humans evolved over the years.

            "content": "The Truth: An Uncomfortable Book About Relationships by Neil Strauss . My rating: 4 of 5 stars . Review . This book discusses various aspects of Niel’s life from childhood to his present life and informs us how the past, especially childhood, can still influence the present and the future.Laurene’s idea of a healthy relationship stuck in my head as I think a lot about what it means to be independent as an individual and in a relationship. In relationships where a person depends on another person for several needs (for example, financial needs), how do the dynamics of the healthy relationship change? . A healthy relationship is when two individuated adults decide to have a relationship, and that becomes a third entity. They nurture the relationship, and the relationship nurtures them. But they’re not overly dependent or independent, but they are interdependent, which means that they take care of most of their needs and wants on their own. When they can’t do something on their own, they are not afraid to ask their partner for help. When our love for someone exceeds our need for them to, we have a shot at a genuine relationship together . Oh my!! Neil goes completely crazy when he decides to leave the therapy altogether to explore poly lifestyle. But it’s tough to be confident about the recovery process when there are red flags around the recovery steps and the process. Neil couldn’t trust the system that failed to make any logical sense to him as his teachers had hidden motives and so failed to answer all his logical questionsThe third part of the book expands a lot on his new lifestyle often unnecessarily. The ending seems rushed with over simplification of his issues and failure to add any details about the life of Neil and Ingrid around the time they decide to get married . Overall, the book feels like a honest narrative of a narcissistic person who tried to find the meaning of love within the constraints posed by his own lifestyle and upbringing. I came to know that in 2018, the couple filed for divorce and are happily(sic) separated. So the reader should exercise some caution while making conclusions from the book about love and relationships. View all my reviews .",

            "content": "Stoner by John Williams . My rating: 5 of 5 stars . Review . I read Stoner after I completed the Three-Body Problem series. I had to spend some time to transition from non-linear story to linear story writing. . When I think about Bill’s parents, all I can think of are the ways they tried to help Bill to succeed in his life. They tried their best to support Bill with money, college education, marriage, etc. They never imposed any of their necessities on Bill. Bill is also empathetic of his parent’s life and difficulties. As Bill aged, he and his parents became strangers and he felt that his love increased by its loss . “If you think you ought to stay here and study your books, then that’s what you ought to do” - Bill’s father on spending additional years at the University for Master of Arts . “Think you could manage the place all by yourself?” - Bill to his parents while mentioning that he won’t be coming back . Bill’s marriage is a disaster. And that is one of the biggest mistakes of his life. It’s so tough to see him struggle through the marriage without ever being loved until Katherine entered into his life. . “He stared up into the dark and wondered at the strangeness that had come over his life, and for the first time questioned the wisdom of what he was about to do” - Bill contemplating on his marriage . While Bill is numb to certain feelings (world wars, patriotism, office politics), he is deeply interested in literature and teaching and thus spends a lot of time in the university. The university becomes his go-to place to avoid struggles at home and social life . During his early 40s, he had a midlife crisis where he questions his past and future. But when Katherine enters his life at 43, he had a turnaround. He leads two separate lives - one with Katherine and one with Edith. Their relationship turns from passion, to lust, and finally to love. But due to the fight with Holly, he had to suffer through his academics and love life . “that the person one loves at first is not the person one loves at last, and that love is not an end but a process through which one person attempts to know another” - when Katherine left Bill . “Oh, how proper we seem to ourselves when we have no reason to be improper” Katherine and Bill on being improper . Bill is devoid of any feeling in his life after Katherine leaves him. He doesn’t care for Edith’s tantrums or for his daughter’s college life. . In the end, this book is neither for one looking for motivation nor for one who is looking for a happy ending. It’s a depressing book that is brutally honest about a person who manages to feel all the emotions that life had to offer him and not willing to bend of any one emotion. He took pride and enjoyment in his education, accepted tumultuous life with Edith, suffered while teaching 3-4 courses every semester for almost 40 years, didn’t hold back when he aspired for love outside his marriage, didn’t fight against the department head until the end, etc. . “He had conceived wisdom, and at the end of the long years he had found ignorance” - Bill at the end of his life View all my reviews .

            "content": "Death’s End by Liu Cixin My rating: 5 of 5 stars I like the way how it all ended. Liu introduced so many ideas and adds lot of context to them. For example, all the stories related to the Storyless Kingdom , Bunker Project, Sophons, and Museums on Pluto made the book really interesting. The book is centered around Cheng Xin who had to bear the consequences of her actions when Trisolaris tried to attack and when she stops Thomas Wade from continuing his particle accelerator research. She never ceased to be human even when she entered the space and got freed from EarthIt’s tough to understand the struggle faced by BlueSpace and Origin crew members but the concepts about “Desubstantiation effect”, conscience and duty in the Outer space can help reader imagine how humans can possibly change once they leave Earth . “Desubstantiation effect” was a concept from astronautic psychology. Humans on Earth were surrounded by objects, and the image of the world in their subconscious was thus material and substantial. But in deep space, away from the Solar System, the stars were only distant points of light and the galaxy was nothing more than a luminous mist. To the senses and the mind, the world lost its materiality, and empty space dominated . There are also some philosophical questions that Liu raised through out this book1. What happens to life when it becomes calm and dull, with no more changes, no more stimulation and surprises2. How survival can be effected by weakness, ignorance and arrogance3.

This book discusses various issues humans face when the battle gets inevitable—defeatism, triumphalism, nostalgic feelings, future civilization, etc. The issues are conveyed by intertwining them in the book narration . Tri-Solaris attempts to assassinate Luo Ji using a custom virus mapped to his DNA in the standard era, and the killer 5.2 software virus in the crisis-era shows the author’s creativity to adapt the writing style. . The birth of a new civilization is the formation of a new morality . Zhang Behai’s portrayal as a triumphalist despite being a defeatist shows his meticulous planning and his responsibility towards its duties. The new Space Earth civilization has to adapt to a new home and change their morality to survive in the spaceship. . Not being able to save the world isn’t your fault, but giving the world hope only to shatter it again is an unforgivable sin . The way Luo Ji gets ridiculed after being called the Messiah for saving the Earth shows us how humans react to hope and how powerful and malleable it is . The book picks up the pace in the last 1/3 of the book, which I could finish in one sitting. I had to struggle through some portions in the first two sections of the book. The Battle of Darkness with the droplet’s superior surface composition changed the whole expectation from the war . I am not sure what to expect for the final book Death’s End as this book ties a lot of loose ends and completes without much curiosity about the next book.
