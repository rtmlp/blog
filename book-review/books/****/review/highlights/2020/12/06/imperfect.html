<h3 id="review">Review</h3>

<p>I have not watched any match that Sanjay played for India, but I watched many matches in which he was a commentator. I liked his commentary, and as he came across as someone who is not afraid to call a spade as a spade. <br /><br />Coming to this book, I liked the first few chapters, where Sanjay explained how his childhood shaped his career choice as a cricketer and his batting style (defensive). Sanjay played cricket for fame and is forthcoming about it. <br /><br />It is interesting to read about Mumbai cricket scene, Ranji tournaments, and North vs West zone rivalry. Sadly, Sanjay played cricket when India is not competitive in away matches, not aggressive in their approach towards the game, and not supportive to fellow cricketers. <br /><br />Since I did not watch any of his matches, I could not connect to much of Sanjay’s cricketing life. However, in the last chapter, Sanjay goes into the details about his life as a commentator. Sanjay chose to be a commentator to be visible in the public eye and not fade out like other cricketers in his generation. As a commentator, Sanjay can get extremely critical because of his analytical mindset. However, many cricketers/viewers took it personally instead of seeing it as a person doing his job. I am glad Sanjay is not backing down from being critical as some of the commentators do not trust the intelligence of the viewers. <br /><br />It is a welcoming book if you are interested in the game. Former cricketers, in their autobiographies, tend to glorify their struggle or game or write about controversies to sell but this book isn’t

<h3 id="highlights---21">Highlights - 21</h3>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>I realize now, seventeen years after quitting the game, that I played cricket because it served a purpose at the time and not really because I deeply loved the game.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ page 2, loc. 41-42</sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>I also want young aspiring sportsmen to learn from my career. Like a father said to his son: ‘I made twenty mistakes in my life; you’ll make twenty new ones.’</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ page 4, loc. 79-80</sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>As a child, I– along with my mother and two sisters – only remember having to bear the brunt of his mood swings and temper.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ page 6, loc. 103-104</sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>As a child, I– along with my mother and two sisters – only remember having to bear the brunt of his mood swings and temper. We lived in the fear of showdowns – often it made us dash towards the windows to close them lest the neighbours heard us. Some of these showdowns even got violent.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ page 6, loc. 103-105</sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>father was oblivious to the devastating effect such scenes had on his family. The result – we lived in constant fear and tension when he was among us.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ page 7, loc. 120-121</sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>observers of my game thought I was overcautious as a batsman, that I could have played with a little more freedom. Maybe they were right. Maybe my game reflected the way I grew up as a child.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ page 8, loc. 138-139</sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, who neither has agendas nor beats around the bush, said that he was the best Indian batsman he’d seen.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ page 9, loc. 150-151</sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>Today I might carry some insecurities and anxieties because of that childhood,</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ page 11, loc. 183-184</sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>Today I might carry some insecurities and anxieties because of that childhood, but I will never hold a grudge against him.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ page 11, loc. 183-184</sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>Having emotions is easy. You don’t have to work towards them; they are just there. Doing your duty, however, as a son, as a husband, as a parent, as an employee, needs commitment and sacrifice. That’s tougher than being emotional.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ page 12, loc. 187-188</sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>I have seen people fail in their important duties and fumble their way through life just because they let their emotions get the better of them. I feel sorry for such people, but I feel sorrier for those who depend on them.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ page 12, loc. 190-191</sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>He truly knew the meaning of such gestures. I remember when he wrote a special letter to Sachin Tendulkar when he did not get the best junior cricketer award.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ page 22, loc. 328-329</sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>Maybe it’s because you tend to remember struggles more vividly than the flawless patches of your career.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ page 31, loc. 459-459</sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>To get over the fear of the hard cricket ball was a basic challenge to conquer before we could move on to other issues of batting.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ page 48, loc. 714-715</sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>In a way, we train ourselves in such a way that our defeats end up hurting our fans more than they hurt us. I should know – I was a fan once. When Javed</li>

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ page 107, loc. 1548-1549</sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>I remember managing to rein it in through my sheer self-confidence at the time. Now that I was older and filled with self-doubt, was that protective instinct raising its head again after so many years?</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ page 107, loc. 1548-1549</sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>Thinkers by nature don’t usually make good cricketers because a lot of cricket is about letting instincts take over.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ page 118, loc. 1698-1699</sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>Madhavi, she had been witness to my frustrations over the last five years or so. I was exhausted trying to save my career, trying to swim against the tide, trying to stay afloat, waiting for the tide to turn so that I could at least enjoy being there.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ page 121, loc. 1752-1753</sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>This is not a job where you make friends with your subject, but give the viewers and listeners your honest view of what’s going on out there, and at the same time remain immune to what the player may think of you. You are not catering to him.</li>
</ul>
