<h3 id="review">Review</h3>

<p>I read <em>Stoner</em> after I completed the <i>Three-Body Problem </i> series. I had to spend some time to transition from non-linear story to linear story writing.</p>

<p>When I think about Bill’s parents, all I can think of are the ways they tried to help Bill to succeed in his life. They tried their best to support Bill with money, college education, marriage, etc. They never imposed any of their necessities on Bill. Bill is also empathetic of his parent’s life and difficulties. As Bill aged, he and his parents became strangers and he felt that his love increased by its loss</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If you think you ought to stay here and study your books, then that’s what you ought to do” - Bill’s father on spending additional years at the University for Master of Arts</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Think you could manage the place all by yourself?” - Bill to his parents while mentioning that he won’t be coming back</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bill’s marriage is a disaster. And that is one of the biggest mistakes of his life. It’s so tough to see him struggle through the marriage without ever being loved until Katherine entered into his life.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“He stared up into the dark and wondered at the strangeness that had come over his life, and for the first time questioned the wisdom of what he was about to do” - Bill contemplating on his marriage</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While Bill is numb to certain feelings (world wars, patriotism, office politics), he is deeply interested in literature and teaching and thus spends a lot of time in the university. The university becomes his go-to place to avoid struggles at home and social life</p>

<p>During his early 40s, he had a midlife crisis where he questions his past and future. But when Katherine enters his life at 43, he had a turnaround. He leads two separate lives - one with Katherine and one with Edith. Their relationship turns from passion, to lust, and finally to love. But due to the fight with Holly, he had to suffer through his academics and love life</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“that the person one loves at first is not the person one loves at last, and that love is not an end but a process through which one person attempts to know another” - when Katherine left Bill</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Oh, how proper we seem to ourselves when we have no reason to be improper” Katherine and Bill on being improper</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bill is devoid of any feeling in his life after Katherine leaves him. He doesn’t care for Edith’s tantrums or for his daughter’s college life.</p>

<p>In the end, this book is neither for one looking for motivation nor for one who is looking for a happy ending. It’s a depressing book that is brutally honest about a person who manages to feel all the emotions that life had to offer him and not willing to bend of any one emotion. He took pride and enjoyment in his education, accepted tumultuous life with Edith, suffered while teaching 3-4 courses every semester for almost 40 years, didn’t hold back when he aspired for love outside his marriage, didn’t fight against the department head until the end, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“He had conceived wisdom, and at the end of the long years he had found ignorance” - Bill at the end of his life
