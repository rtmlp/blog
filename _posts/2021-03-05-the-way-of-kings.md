My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3503433696">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
<blockquote> Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination. I will protect those who cannot protect themselves </blockquote><br /><br />Masterpiece !!! The best fiction book that I have read so far. When I started reading this book, I was unsure whether I could invest time in reading all the books in series (10 in total) as the first book alone has 1137 pages. But it was totally worth the read. The book established the characters, society, themes and concepts in the Cosmere world really well. In the last quarter of the book, I couldn't put down this book without reading it straight for three hours in a day. By the time I finished reading this book, I had got so astonished by the twists and turns and took few hours to just absorb what I had just read<br /><br />I am excited to start the second book in this series, <i> Words of radiance </i> :)
