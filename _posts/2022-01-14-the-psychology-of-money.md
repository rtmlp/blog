### Review
---

Enjoyed reading this book. In the first few chapters, I got a bit impatient with the extended narrative on simple things but the author introduced several interesting ways to think about money, investing, risk, happiness, and growth. <br /><br />The idea of saving money just for the sake of it and not specifically for anything is anti-thesis of how saving money is being campaigned in the mainstream media. <br /><br />The last section on how the united states turned from a savings economy (before world war II) to a consumer economy and how that is impacting the debt to income ratio metric is interesting.

### Highlights - 137

* The fact that Ronald Read can coexist with Richard Fuscone has two explanations. One, financial outcomes are driven by luck, independent of intelligence and effort. That’s true to some extent, and this book will discuss it in further detail. Or, two (and I think more common), that financial success is not a hard science. It’s a soft skill, where how you behave is more important than what you know.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 74-77</sup></p>

* Most of the reason why, I believe, is that we think about and are taught about money in ways that are too much like physics (with rules and laws) and not enough like psychology (with emotions and nuance).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 95-97</sup></p>

* Your personal experiences with money make up maybe 0.00000001% of what’s happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how you think the world works.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 134-135</sup></p>

* “Our findings suggest that individual investors’ willingness to bear risk depends on personal history.”

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 162-163</sup></p>

* Few people make financial decisions purely with a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a company meeting. Places where personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together into a narrative that works for you.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 219-221</sup></p>

* It should surprise no one that many of us are bad at saving and investing for retirement. We’re not crazy. We’re all just newbies.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 241-242</sup></p>

* For a topic that is so influenced by emotion versus fact, this is a problem. And it helps explain why we don’t always do what we’re supposed to with money.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 250-252</sup></p>

* “Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems.”

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 257-257</sup></p>

* Luck and risk are both the reality that every outcome in life is guided by forces other than individual effort.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 297-298</sup></p>

* Luck and risk are both the reality that every outcome in life is guided by forces other than individual effort. They are so similar that you can’t believe in one without equally respecting the other. They both happen because the world is too complex to allow 100% of your actions to dictate 100% of your outcomes. They are driven by the same thing: You are one person in a game with seven billion other people and infinite moving parts. The accidental impact of actions outside of your control can be more consequential than the ones you consciously take.

* They are so similar that you can’t believe in one without equally respecting the other.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 298-299</sup></p>

* When judging others, attributing success to luck makes you look jealous and mean, even if we know it exists. And when judging yourself, attributing success to luck can be too demoralizing to accept.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 311-312</sup></p>

* It’s too hard. We prefer simple stories, which are easy but often devilishly misleading.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 325-325</sup></p>

* Be careful who you praise and admire. Be careful who you look down upon and wish to avoid becoming.

* Therefore, focus less on specific individuals and case studies and more on broad patterns.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 377-378</sup></p>

* My favorite historian, Frederick Lewis Allen, spent his career depicting the life of the average, median American—how they lived, how they changed, what they did for work, what they ate for dinner, etc.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 386-387</sup></p>

* When things are going extremely well, realize it’s not as good as you think. You are not invincible, and if you acknowledge that luck brought you success then you have to believe in luck’s cousin, risk, which can turn your story around just as quickly.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 390-391</sup></p>

* Crime committed by those living on the edge of survival is one thing. A Nigerian scam artist once told The New York Times that he felt guilty for hurting others, but “poverty will not make you feel the pain.”¹³

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 442-443</sup></p>

* To make money they didn’t have and didn’t need, they risked what they did have and did need. And that’s foolish. It is just plain foolish.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 449-450</sup></p>

* If you risk something that is important to you for something that is unimportant to you, it just does not make any sense.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 450-451</sup></p>

* Modern capitalism is a pro at two things: generating wealth and generating envy.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 460-460</sup></p>

* On the other end there’s Rajat Guptas and Bernie Madoffs in the world, who resort to stealing because every dollar is worth reaching for regardless of consequence.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 481-482</sup></p>

* The ability to stick around for a long time, without wiping out or being forced to give up, is what makes the biggest difference. This should be the cornerstone of your strategy, whether it’s in investing or your career or a business you own.

* He survived. Survival gave him longevity. And longevity—investing consistently from age 10 to at least age 89—is what made compounding work wonders. That single point is what matters most when describing his success.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 645-646</sup></p>

* No one wants to hold cash during a bull market. They want to own assets that go up a lot. You look and feel conservative holding cash during a bull market, because you become acutely aware of how much return you’re giving up by not owning the good stuff. Say cash earns 1% and stocks return 10% a year. That 9% gap will gnaw at you every day. But if that cash prevents you from having to sell your stocks during a bear market, the actual return you earned on that cash is not 1% a year—it could be many multiples of that, because preventing one desperate, ill-timed stock sale can do more for your lifetime returns than picking dozens of big-time winners.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 661-666</sup></p>

* Many bets fail not because they were wrong, but because they were mostly right in a situation that required things to be exactly right.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 678-679</sup></p>

* Room for error—often called margin of safety—is one of the most underappreciated forces in finance. It comes in many forms: A frugal budget, flexible thinking, and a loose timeline—anything that lets you live happily with a range of outcomes.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 680-681</sup></p>

* Conservative is avoiding a certain level of risk. Margin of safety is raising the odds of success at a given level of risk by increasing your chances of survival.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 682-683</sup></p>

* A mindset that can be paranoid and optimistic at the same time is hard to maintain, because seeing things as black or white takes less effort than accepting nuance.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 708-709</sup></p>

* The highest form of wealth is the ability to wake up every morning and say, “I can do whatever I want today.”

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 847-848</sup></p>

* Happiness is a complicated subject because everyone’s different. But if there’s a common denominator in happiness— a universal fuel of joy—it’s that people want to control their lives.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 849-850</sup></p>

* Having a strong sense of controlling one’s life is a more dependable predictor of positive feelings of wellbeing than any of the objective conditions of life we have considered.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 858-859</sup></p>

* Money’s greatest intrinsic value—and this can’t be overstated —is its ability to give you control over your time.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 861-862</sup></p>

* But doing something you love on a schedule you can’t control can feel the same as doing something you hate. There is a name for this feeling. Psychologists call it reactance.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 879-880</sup></p>

* When we try to get them to do something, they feel disempowered. Rather than feeling like they made the choice, they feel like we made it for them. So they say no or do something else, even when they might have originally been happy to go along.²⁵

* “There is no faster way to feel rich than to spend lots of money on really nice things. But the way to be rich is to spend money you have, and to not spend money you don’t have. It’s really that simple.”³¹

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 985-986</sup></p>

* It is excellent advice, but it may not go far enough. The only way to be wealthy is to not spend the money that you do have. It’s not just the only way to accumulate wealth; it’s the very definition of wealth.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 986-988</sup></p>

* Not knowing the difference is a source of countless poor money decisions.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 989-989</sup></p>

* But wealth is hidden. It’s income not spent.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 992-992</sup></p>

* The first idea—simple, but easy to overlook—is that building wealth has little to do with your income or investment returns, and lots to do with your savings

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1021-1022</sup></p>

* Learning to be happy with less money creates a gap between what you have and what you want—similar to the gap you get from growing your paycheck, but easier and more in your control.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1078-1079</sup></p>

* When you don’t have control over your time, you’re forced to accept whatever bad luck is thrown your way. But if you have flexibility you have the time to wait for no-brainer opportunities to fall in your lap. This is a hidden return on your savings.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1208-1209</sup></p>

* History is littered with good ideas taken too far, which are indistinguishable from bad ideas. The wisdom in having room for error is acknowledging that uncertainty, randomness, and chance—“unknowns”—are an ever-present part of life. The only way to deal with them is by increasing the gap between what you think will happen and what can happen while still leaving you capable of fighting another day.

* But people underestimate the need for room for error in almost everything they do that involves money.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1383-1384</sup></p>

* Leverage is the devil here. Leverage—taking on debt to make your money go further—pushes routine risks into something capable of producing ruin.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1430-1431</sup></p>

* Imagining a goal is easy and fun. Imagining a goal in the context of the realistic life stresses that grow with competitive pursuits is something entirely different.

* Aiming, at every point in your working life, to have moderate annual savings, moderate free time, no more than a moderate commute, and at least moderate time with your family, increases the odds of being able to stick with a plan and avoid regret than if any one of those things fall to the extreme sides of the spectrum.

* Most things are harder in practice than they are in theory. Sometimes this is because we’re overconfident. More often it’s because we’re not good at identifying what the price of success is, which prevents us from being able to pay it.
